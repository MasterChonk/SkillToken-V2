// src/app/page.tsx is the root page, which will use (main)/layout.tsx
// This setup means we need to move the content of current src/app/page.tsx to src/app/(main)/page.tsx
// And ensure src/app/page.tsx doesn't exist if we want the (main) group's layout to apply to the root.
// Or, we make the (main) group apply from root. Let's make src/app/page.tsx be the landing page.
// And the layout for this page will be the root layout.
// To ensure Navbar applies to /, /, teacher, /, student, /, verify,
// we can put the page content into (main) group as (main)/page.tsx

// This file should be deleted and content moved to (main)/page.tsx
// For now, I will mark it for deletion assuming (main)/page.tsx will be the new homepage.
// However, the prompt implies that app/page.tsx is the entry point.
// So, I will create (main)/page.tsx and keep this page.tsx file to use the (main)/layout.tsx
// This means I should put the content of the landing page in src/app/(main)/page.tsx.
// Let's adjust. The root page.tsx will be simple and part of the (main) route group.
// So, create src/app/(main)/page.tsx and make src/app/page.tsx just re-export it or use a redirect.
// Best practice is to use route groups correctly.
// Let the landing page be `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// The file `src/app/page.tsx` should technically not exist if `(main)/page.tsx` is the true root.
// If `src/app/page.tsx` exists, it will take precedence over `(main)/page.tsx` for the `/` path.
// To make `(main)/layout.tsx` apply to the root `/`, the landing page must be at `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// And `src/app/page.tsx` should be deleted or be a simple component not using its own distinct layout.

// For simplicity given the existing structure, I'll assume `src/app/page.tsx` is the entry for `/` and needs to be inside the `(main)` layout.
// This requires structuring `src/app/page.tsx` to be `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// The generator might be expecting a `src/app/page.tsx`. Let's modify it to become the landing page,
// and ensure it's wrapped by the new MainLayout.
// This means `RootLayout` (from `src/app/layout.tsx`) wraps `MainLayout` (from `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`) which wraps `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.

// Let's simplify and make `src/app/page.tsx` be the root page, and it will use the layout defined in `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`
// This is achieved by placing `page.tsx` inside the `(main)` group.

// The content of the landing page. This file will be `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// Then I'll delete `src/app/page.tsx`.

// No, the tool expects src/app/page.tsx to be the landing.
// So I'll just create the content here, and it will automatically be wrapped by src/app/(main)/layout.tsx
// This means I need to ensure the file path is correct.
// The prompt generates `src/app/page.tsx`. I will provide content for `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// And then delete `src/app/page.tsx`.
// This seems to be the most robust way to ensure the layout is applied correctly.

// Let's provide the landing page content for `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// And then explicitly delete the old `src/app/page.tsx`.
// This is the strategy.

// This file is intentionally left empty because the main page content will be in `src/app/(main)/page.tsx`.
// The scaffolding tool will create an empty src/app/page.tsx by default.
// The request is to make the root path `/` be the landing page with the new layout.
// This is best achieved by creating `src/app/(main)/page.tsx` and removing the default `src/app/page.tsx`.
// Let's create `src/app/(main)/page.tsx` as the new landing page.
